# Requirements and design
*You analyze (non-functional) requirements, elaborate (architectural) designs and validate them using multiple types of test techniques*

# Requirements Analysis
In our group project, we received a document from our product owners outlining the project requirements and expectations.
As a team, we analyzed these requirements and converted them into user stories. These user stories serve as the basis for our sprints
and guide the implementation of features into our project. The use of user stories and sprints aligns with our Agile methodology,
which promotes iterative and collaborative development.

# Elaborating Designs
In our group project, we created our own architectural design, which we discussed with both our product owners (who have industry experience)
and our teachers. These discussions helped refine and validate our architectural designs. Additionally, for designing and building the front-end
of our project, we utilize Figma. This tool allows us to create visual designs for our user interface, ensuring that everyone involved is on the
same page. It also facilitates discussions with the product owners, enabling us to incorporate their ideas and feedback into the application's development.

In the Individual Project, I also developed an [architectural design]().

# Test Techniques
To ensure that we are meeting the requirements set by our product owners, we place a strong emphasis on obtaining feedback on the product we are building.
User acceptance testing plays a crucial role in gathering this feedback. We allow individuals, including members of our development group, product owners,
and teachers, to use our product and provide feedback on the user experience. By incorporating this feedback, we continuously improve our product and align
it with the desired goals and expectations.
