# Web application
***

I created a user-friendly web application by prioritizing a simplistic and appealing design. My main focus was on creating a clean and intuitive user interface to ensure that users could easily navigate and interact with the app.

## User-Friendly
***
My objective in developing a web application was to prioritize user-friendliness by employing a simplistic and visually appealing design. Central to this goal was creating a clean and intuitive user interface that would enable effortless navigation and seamless interaction for users.

To achieve this, I paid careful attention to the overall layout and visual elements of the application. I opted for a minimalistic design approach, eliminating unnecessary clutter and distractions. By incorporating ample white space and employing a consistent and logical arrangement of elements, 
I aimed to provide users with a clear and uncluttered interface.

Moreover, I conducted user testing and gathered feedback throughout the development process.

In summary, my primary focus in developing the web application was to create a user-friendly experience. By prioritizing a simplistic and appealing design and emphasizing a clean and intuitive user interface, I aimed to ensure that users could effortlessly navigate and interact 
with the application, resulting in an enjoyable and satisfying user experience.

## Full-stack
***

During my individual project, I successfully developed a full stack web application by employing Vue 3 with JavaScript for the front end and TypeScript with Node.js for backend. After conducting thorough research, I determined that Vue 3 in combination with JavaScript, would provide an
efficient framework for creating the user interface of my application and Google Maps API usage. By leveraging Vue's component-based architecture, I was able to ensure a reliable and scalable front-end solution.

For the back end of my application, I opted to use Typescritpt and Node.js. This allowed me to build an API for sending and retrieving data to Database. By utilizing TypeScript on the server side, I ensured structurized looking, compatibility and smooth
communication between the front-end components and the API.

Although I used an mongoose ORM for communicating with non-sql Database MongoDB.
