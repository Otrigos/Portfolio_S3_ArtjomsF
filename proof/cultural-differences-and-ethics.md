# Cultural Differences and Ethical Considerations in Software Development

## Ethical Programming Guidelines

***

Ethics, in general, refer to moral principles governing behavior and conduct in various activities. In software engineering, ethical considerations hold great significance due to the global impact of the products we develop, affecting billions of users worldwide.

# ACM Guidelines

***

The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), the world's largest educational and scientific computing society, has developed its own Code of Ethics. These ethical principles have also been endorsed by the IEEE as the standard for teaching and practicing software engineering.
Adhering to these guidelines helps promote responsible and ethical conduct in the field of software development.

By actively recognizing and integrating cultural differences and ethical principles into our software development processes, we can ensure the creation of products that meet the needs of stakeholders while upholding ethical standards in our work.

### Here you can find the [ethical principles](https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics) by the ACM.

### Cultural differences
Since cultural differences are more related with Gorup work, you can explore a page about that in the Group Project in which im am involved [here](https://github.com/Null-Not-Found/DashBuddy-Documentation/blob/main/Learning%20Outcomes/Cultural%20differences%20and%20ethics.md).
