# Agile - Continuous Improvement in Software Development

***

The use of software tools and methodologies that enable continuous monitoring and enhancement of software quality during the development process is known as Agile. Agile is an iterative and incremental approach to project management and software development that prioritizes flexibility, collaboration,
and adaptability. By breaking down projects into smaller sprints or iterations, teams work together to deliver the final product. Agile methodologies promote close collaboration, transparent communication, and frequent meetings to track progress and address challenges. One of the key principles of Agile
is its ability to embrace change and adjust plans based on feedback and evolving requirements, resulting in a fluid and responsive development process.

# Jira - Enabling Agile Practices

***

Using the right tools can make your work a lot easier. At the beginning of our project we had considered different tools like Trello, and GitHub Projects. Eventually we chose to use Jira, as it is widely used by professional teams, and it also allows us to integrate our tasks with our GitHub Repositories.

# Scrum - Effective Project Management Framework

***

For my recent project, I implemented the Scrum framework to manage the development process efficiently. I divided the project into manageable sprints, each lasting two weeks. At the end of each sprint, I conducted retrospectives using ChatGPT and sprint reviews. These sessions allowed me to reflect
on my progress, identify areas for improvement, and make necessary adjustments for future sprints. The retrospectives and sprint reviews played a crucial role in fostering a culture of continuous learning and ensuring that my project stayed on track.

Daily Structure and Sprint Overview

Our team follows a structured daily routine to ensure effective communication and progress tracking. Each day begins with a standup meeting where every team member outlines their planned tasks and activities for the day. During this meeting, the Scrum Master updates the project board, making necessary 
adjustments and ensuring that the team is aligned.

To manage our project efficiently, we have divided it into sprints, typically lasting 3 to 4 weeks. At the end of each sprint, we conduct a sprint review and retrospective. During the sprint review, we present our work to the stakeholders, seeking their feedback and validation. This is an opportunity
to introduce new backlog items and user stories and assess the significance of existing tasks. Based on the stakeholders' input, we can reprioritize our workload, giving greater emphasis to more immediate story points. Following the review, we hold a retrospective meeting, which involves only the
team members. In this meeting, we reflect on the sprint, identifying both successful aspects and areas for improvement.

Definition of Done

As a team, we have collectively defined a specific set of criteria that our code must meet to be considered "done." This set of criteria is known as our Definition of Done. It serves as a benchmark against which we evaluate the completion and quality of our code. Adhering to this definition
ensures that our work is consistent, reliable, and meets the project's requirements and standards.

The backlog contains the user stories, and tasks are assigned as a child issues in it.

The sprint planning gives an overview of all tasks that have to be done(or have another status) for each user story.
