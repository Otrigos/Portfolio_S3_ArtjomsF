# Professionalism
*You act in a professional manner during software development and learning.*

## Professionalism towards the stakeholders
In order to demonstrate our professionalism to project stakeholders, we place a strong emphasis on effective communication. 
Apart from the regular communication that occurs during sprint reviews and between sprints, we make it a priority to keep stakeholders 
well-informed about the status of our project before each sprint review. This proactive approach ensures that stakeholders are aware of 
what to expect during the sprint reviews and eliminates any unexpected surprises regarding our progress. By maintaining transparent and
consistent communication, we aim to build trust and confidence with our stakeholders, showcasing our commitment to delivering a successful project.

## Professionalism within the group
In order to work professionally within our group, we have 
[setted up a coding convections](https://github.com/Null-Not-Found/DashBuddy-Documentation/blob/main/Coding%20conventions.md) and also a
The coding convections is a series of rules, to make sure we can work together as smoothly as possible regarding our software developement.

The reason we've set up this document is so we can work together better, and everyone knows what to expect from each other.


## Research
During this semester I've been working mainly on research and you can finds some documents about that.
You can view the [research papers here](https://github.com/Otrigos/Portfolio_S3_ArtjomsF/tree/main/Research).

## Feedback
Receiving feedback about the progress you've made is crucial to stay on the right track. To ensure I gather sufficient feedback,
I actively seek input from my teachers as well as other students in my class. For tracking and managing the feedback received from my teachers,
I utilize a tool called Feedpulse. This tool allows me to document multiple feedback moments over time, enabling me to keep a record of our discussions.

Once I receive feedback from a teacher, I take detailed notes regarding our conversation. These notes capture the key points discussed and any
suggestions or recommendations provided. The teacher also has the opportunity to review my notes and provide additional comments or insights.
Moreover, the tool allows the teacher to express their evaluation of my progress using smiley indicators, which serve as a visual representation
of their assessment.

By leveraging Feedpulse and actively seeking feedback from both teachers and peers, I can effectively monitor my progress and ensure that
I am continuously improving and aligning with the desired outcomes. This feedback-driven approach helps me stay focused, make necessary
adjustments, and ultimately enhance my learning and development journey.
