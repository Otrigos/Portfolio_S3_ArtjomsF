## Reasons for Using an Existing Maps Data API
***
Working on my project, I realized that I need a huge amount of data for working with addresses. Choosing existing Maps API sounds like the most resonable solution in current conditions, because: First of all it's gonna give a big boost in development, instead of recreating whole city map, I can get access to existing service. Secondly I can get easy access to all addresses and point in city. Validation of address which is not less important part also available using Maps API. Third reason is computing of the routes, which is hardly reachable working alone with time limitations. 

In addition, existing Maps API usage will give the most accurate information, which is updated by reliable company, so it will lead to minimalizing of errors.

## Google Maps API
***

Looking on Maps APIs to work with, obviously Google Maps API took the most of attention. It's trustable company for a years, which updates their data constantly. I have chosen that specific Maps API because I'm really familliar with it since I have been using it for a years. Google Maps API also provide all services required for my project such as: Maps initialization, Address validation, Route calculation. What is also important Google Maps API allow styling so I can draw the maps in a different way, limit not needed points for maps (For example shops, beucause rider don't need to see shops during their ride).


## Conclusion
***
Google Maps API is the perfect choice for individual development, since it's free for developing. Usage will cost the money, but that's not a problem as far as my project is just playing with maps and understanding how to work with them.
