## Intro
***
### Welcome to my portfolio! 
Hello, my name is Artjoms Figurins, and I am thrilled to introduce my personal project for the 3rd semester of ICT at Fontys University. Over the course of this semester, I have been focused on developing a web application called Rider Maps. This cutting-edge app aims to streamline the process of navigating through various routes and destinations for riders. By taking into account user preferences and input regarding their travel needs.
