# Retrospective 1
***
Me: My sprint is almost done and it's time to do retrospective, can you do that with me?

ChatGPT: Of course! I'd be happy to help you with your retrospective. A retrospective is an important part of the agile development process, where the team reflects on the sprint that just ended and identifies what went well, what could have gone better, and actions to improve in the next sprint. Let's get started!

Me: During my first sprint I mainly did a lot of research starting with JavaScript, which I never used before. Later I started to look any maps API and found Google Maps API for fast access to the services. I configured front-end for setting, validating and sending the addresses

ChatGPT: Great! It sounds like you made good progress during the sprint by conducting research on JavaScript and finding a suitable maps API, specifically the Google Maps API. You also worked on configuring the front-end to handle setting, validating, and sending addresses.

Based on this, here are some points to consider for what went well during the sprint:

Proactive research: Conducting research on a new technology like JavaScript and finding a suitable maps API shows initiative and proactivity in learning and exploring new technologies.

Efficient use of external resources: Identifying and utilizing the Google Maps API for fast access to mapping services is a smart decision that can save development time and effort.

Front-end configuration: Configuring the front-end for setting, validating, and sending addresses demonstrates progress in implementing the desired functionality.

Now, let's consider what could have been improved during the sprint:

Time management: Since research took up a significant portion of the sprint, it's important to ensure that enough time is allocated for actual development and implementation to avoid potential delays.

Documentation: Keeping track of the research findings, configuration details, and any other relevant information in documentation can be helpful for future reference and knowledge sharing.

Based on the challenges you faced and the successes achieved, here are some actions that can be taken to improve in the next sprint:

Time-box research: Plan and allocate a specific time-box for research activities to balance it with development tasks and avoid potential delays.

Document findings: Keep a record of research findings, configuration details, and any other relevant information in documentation for future reference and knowledge sharing.

Seek feedback: Request feedback from team members or stakeholders to identify areas of improvement and implement corrective actions.

Overall, it seems like you made good progress during the sprint and have identified areas for improvement. Remember to continuously iterate and improve in subsequent sprints to enhance your development process. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss or any further questions about the retrospective process?
