# Docker

***

Docker is an open-source platform that allows you to automate the deployment and management of applications using containerization. It enables developers to package their applications and their dependencies into lightweight, portable containers that can run consistently across different environments.

# GitHub actions

GitHub Actions is a feature of the GitHub platform that allows you to automate workflows and tasks directly within your repository. It provides a flexible and customizable way to build, test, and deploy your code. GitHub Actions supports integrating with Docker to perform container-based actions and workflows.

***

## Here's how Docker can communicate with GitHub Actions:

### Building Docker Images:

Within GitHub repository defines a GitHub Actions workflow that triggers on specific events such as pushing code or creating a pull request.
As part of the workflow, specifying a step to build a Docker image using Docker commands or a Dockerfile.
The Docker image can be built from the source code in repository, and we can include any necessary dependencies or configurations.

### Pushing Docker Images to a Registry:

After building the Docker image, we are pushing it to a container registry like Docker Hub or GitHub Container Registry.
GitHub Actions provides actions or custom steps that facilitate pushing the Docker image to a registry.
You need to specify the necessary credentials or access tokens in the workflow to authenticate and authorize the push to the registry.
